# Workforce Analysis Dashboard by SQL & Power BI
This project focuses on analyzing workforce data to understand employee distribution, demographics, hiring trends, turnover rate, and department-wise performance.
Using SQL for data cleaning & analysis and Power BI for dashboard creation, the goal is to provide actionable HR insights for data-driven decision-making.

## Project Objective
Clean and transform HR data using SQL

Identify key workforce KPIs

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard

Analyze employee demographics, employment trends, and turnover

Support HR in strategic workforce planning

## Tools & Technologies

SQL (MySQL) – Data cleaning, transformation, KPI calculations

Power BI – Dashboard creation & visualization

Excel/CSV – Raw dataset

DAX – Measures & calculated fields (Power BI)

## SQL Data Cleaning & Preparation

Using SQL, the following tasks were performed:

Corrected inconsistent date formats (birthdate, hire_date, termdate)

Converted text dates into proper DATE format

Removed invalid records (e.g., age < 18)

Added age column using TIMESTAMPDIFF

Identified terminated employees

Prepared cleaned dataset for Power BI visualization

## Key SQL Queries Included

Gender distribution
✔ Race/Ethnicity breakdown
✔ Age group segmentation
✔ Headquarters vs remote employee count
✔ Average length of employment
✔ Job title and department distribution
✔ Annual hire vs termination trend
✔ Department-wise turnover rate
✔ Average employee tenure

# Power BI Dashboard Highlights

1. Employee Demographics

Gender split

Age distribution

Race & ethnicity distribution

Location-based employee count

2. Hiring & Termination Trends

Year-wise hiring trends

Termination trends

Net employee growth

Average length of employment

3. Department & Job Role Insights

Total employees by department

Gender diversity per department

Job title distribution

Department-wise turnover rate

4. Tenure & Workforce Stability

# Key Insights

Turnover rate varies significantly by department

Majority of employees fall in the 25–34 age group

Headquarters has higher employee count compared to remote locations

Certain years show high hiring spikes, followed by increased terminations

Some departments exhibit longer average tenure than others

# Recommendations

Strengthen retention programs for high-turnover departments
Focus recruitment efforts in departments with declining headcount
Enhance diversity efforts where imbalance exists
Improve employee engagement for younger workforce groups
Increase support for remote teams if turnover is high
